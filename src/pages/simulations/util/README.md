# Simulation logic and rendering utilities

This folder has a lot of utility files containing functions to support the simulation logic and rendering.

- [settings](./settings.js) has general simulation settings. This includes both functionality settings (like default values) as well as style settings.
- [simulations](./simulations.js) has general utility functions for simulations. Think of state management and page management.
- [videos](./videos.js) is a small file managing a few video-related functionalities inside simulations, like autoplaying when required.
- [scripts](./scripts.js) has all functionalities for running user-provided scripts.
- [variables](./variables.js) takes care of initializing and managing variables inside the parameter.
- [validation](./validation.js) has scripts that check if parts of a simulation are set up properly. Think of checking whether an update script has no programming errors.
