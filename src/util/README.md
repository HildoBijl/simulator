# Utilities folder

This is the folder where all general functions useful across the entire site are stored. It has the following files.

- [Numbers](./numbers.js) contains everything related to calculations and number processing.
- [Objects](./objects.js) is about manipulating objects/arrays. Think of specific object mapping functions.
- [Strings](./strings.js) relates to text processing, like for instance making the first character of a word upper-case.
- [DOM](./dom.js) has functions that deal with the Document-Object-Model. Basically HTML stuff.
- [React](./react.js) expands the React toolkit with a few custom-made hooks.
